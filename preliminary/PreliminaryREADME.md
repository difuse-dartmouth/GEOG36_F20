Welcome to DIFUSE!

This folder "preliminary" contains the materials that will assist you in creating a data science module. As you continue with development, feel free to store additional starting materials (such as the course syllabus) in this folder as well.

In this folder, you will find:

- difuse_scaffolding
    - "ForYourFirstTeamMeeting.docx"
    Read this to begin design planning for your module. It will prepare you for your first team meeting with the course professor, and enable you to collect information needed to make the Module Outline.

    - "Module Outline Template.docx"
    This is a general outline for DIFUSE modules. When filled out, it will guide your project team (and the rest of DIFUSE) on the goals and development plan of the module.

- tutorials
DIFUSE project teams have used a variety of software/tech stacks to develop modules in the past. Check out this folder to learn more about these software and how they may be of use to you.
